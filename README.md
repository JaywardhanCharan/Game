Here is the 2048-Game , React Development
Link to the hoisted project on netlify - https://jay-2048.netlify.app/
I have made use of latest React features for developing this project.
I have used Redux from State Management. Used basic structure by creating Action.js, Reducer.js and Store.js
I have made use of Sass for styling and giving styles to different components.
I have implemented functionality of Undo, Redo and also Replay and button which gives us the ability to go and watch the previous moves done by us.
